# Implementation Plan: Medicare.gov Plan Compare API Integration

**Branch**: `007-the-system-must` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/007-the-system-must/spec.md`

## Summary
This feature establishes the core integration with the `https://www.medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API. It will involve creating a dedicated backend service to handle all API calls, manage the Referer header, and provide structured data to the rest of the application.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Requests (for API calls), React, Zustand
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Constraints**: Strict adherence to the Medicare API's requirements, including the Referer header. Rate limits and API stability are external factors.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: A dedicated backend service will encapsulate all API interaction logic, keeping it isolated and easy to understand.
- **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD will be applied to the API client and data mapping logic, ensuring correct interaction with the external API.
- **III. Automate Everything**: Automated tests will cover API client functionality, error handling, and data parsing.
- **IV. Explicit Contracts**: The backend service will expose a clear internal API for other services to consume Medicare data. The external contract is defined by the Medicare API's OpenAPI spec.
- **V. Secure by Design**: API calls will adhere to the Referer header requirement. No sensitive data is stored or exposed.

**Structure Decision**: The existing frontend/backend monorepo structure is suitable. A new `medicare_api_client.py` service will be added to the backend.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
**Output**: `data-model.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate backend tasks for setting up the `medicare_api_client` service.
- Generate backend tasks for implementing API calls to retrieve plan, drug, and pharmacy data.
- Generate backend tasks for parsing and mapping API responses to internal data models.
- Generate TDD tasks for API client functionality and error handling.
