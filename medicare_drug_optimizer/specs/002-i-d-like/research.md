# Research: Finding Drug Alternatives

## Decision
The application will use the `medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API (Feature 007) to discover the relationships between different drug products, which is essential for identifying alternatives like brands and generics.

## Rationale
The user has clarified that the Medicare API provides comprehensive drug alternative relationships, making it the preferred and authoritative source.

- **Authoritative Source**: The Medicare API is the official source for plan and drug data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Data**: The API provides the necessary relationships between drugs (generics, brands, biosimilars, etc.) directly, simplifying data acquisition.
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Relying on a single, comprehensive API reduces the number of external dependencies and simplifies the architecture.

## Alternatives Considered
- **NIH RxNorm API**: This was initially considered but is now **rejected** as redundant because the Medicare API (Feature 007) provides comprehensive drug alternative relationships.
- **Web Scraping**: This was previously rejected and remains so.
- **Purchasing a Commercial Drug Database**: This was previously rejected and remains so.
