# Research: Medicare.gov Plan Compare API Integration

## Decision
The application will implement a dedicated backend service (`medicare_api_client.py`) to encapsulate all interactions with the `https://www.medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API.

## Rationale
Centralizing API interaction in a dedicated service provides several benefits:

- **Encapsulation**: All API-specific logic, including HTTP requests, header management (e.g., Referer), and response parsing, is contained in one place.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the external API can be managed and adapted within this single service, minimizing impact on other parts of the application.
- **Testability**: The API client can be thoroughly unit-tested in isolation.
- **Security**: Managing the Referer header and any potential future authentication mechanisms is easier and more secure within a backend service.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Direct API Calls from Frontend**: This was **rejected** because:
    - **CORS Issues**: Direct calls from a different origin would likely be blocked by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies.
    - **Security**: Exposing the API endpoint and Referer header directly in frontend code is less secure.
    - **Complexity**: Managing API logic and error handling in the frontend can lead to a more complex and less maintainable codebase.
