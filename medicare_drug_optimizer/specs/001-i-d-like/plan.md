# Implementation Plan: Medicare Part D Drug Cost Optimizer

**Branch**: `001-i-d-like` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-i-d-like/spec.md`

## Summary
A Medicare beneficiary wants to use the application to find their Part D plan and enter their drug list using medicare.gov's public, unauthenticated tools. The system will then provide guided assistance to optimize costs. This will be a web application with a Python backend to interact with the medicare.gov API and a JavaScript frontend to provide the user interface.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (Python backend), Requests (for API calls), React (frontend), Zustand (state management)
**Storage**: N/A (Session data will be managed in-memory or in the client)
**Testing**: Pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Constraints**: The primary constraint is the reliance on the structure and availability of the `medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API. Changes to the API may break the integration.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: The architecture is a standard, simple frontend/backend split. Direct API integration is simpler and more robust than browser automation.
- **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD will be mandatory for the backend logic that calls the API, parses responses, and calculates costs/recommendations. Frontend components will have corresponding unit tests.
- **III. Automate Everything**: All tests will be automated and run in CI. Linting and formatting will be enforced by pre-commit hooks.
- **IV. Explicit Contracts**: The frontend and backend will communicate via a well-defined REST API. This contract will be documented. The backend will also have an explicit contract with the medicare.gov API.
- **V. Secure by Design**: The application does not store user PII or PHI. API calls will adhere to the Referer header requirement.

**Structure Decision**: A standard monorepo with a `frontend` and `backend` directory is appropriate for this web application.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
**Output**: `data-model.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate backend tasks for setting up FastAPI and the API client for medicare.gov.
- Generate backend tasks for creating the service to interact with the medicare.gov API.
- Generate frontend tasks for building the UI components for plan/drug selection and displaying recommendations.
- Generate TDD tasks for the cost optimization logic.
