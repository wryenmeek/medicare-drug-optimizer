# Implementation Plan: Medicare Part D Drug Cost Optimizer

**Branch**: `001-i-d-like` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-i-d-like/spec.md`

## Summary

A Medicare beneficiary wants to use the application to find their Part D plan and enter their drug list using medicare.gov's public, unauthenticated tools. The system will then provide assistance from a chatbot or interactive agent to optimize costs. This will be a web application with a Python backend to interact with the medicare.gov API and a JavaScript frontend to provide the user interface.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (Python backend), Requests (for API calls), React (frontend), Zustand (state management)
**Storage**: N/A (Session data will be managed in-memory or in the client)
**Testing**: Pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Constraints**: The primary constraint is the reliance on the structure and availability of the `medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API. Changes to the API may break the integration.

## Clarifications

- **Q**: How is "guided assistance" specifically defined in the context of optimizing costs? → **A**: A chatbot or interactive agent providing real-time advice.
- **Q**: What are the lifecycle states of a `UserSession` (e.g., created, active, ended, saved)? → **A**: Created, Active, Saved (user explicitly saves), Loaded (from saved state), Expired.
- **Q**: What are the specific UI states for loading, empty data, and API errors? → **A**: Loading animation, prompt to enter data, service temporarily unavailable message.
- **Q**: What are the specific security requirements for the optional medicare.gov authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth, SAML, direct credentials)? → **A**: No authentication mechanism will be implemented.
- **Q**: What are the expected failure modes and retry strategies for interactions with the `medicare.gov/plan-compare` API? → **A**: 200 (Success), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: The architecture is a standard, simple frontend/backend split. Direct API integration is simpler and more robust than browser automation.
- **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD will be mandatory for the backend logic that calls the API, parses responses, and calculates costs/recommendations. Frontend components will have corresponding unit tests.
- **III. Automate Everything**: All tests will be automated and run in CI. Linting and formatting will be enforced by pre-commit hooks.
- **IV. Explicit Contracts**: The frontend and backend will communicate via a well-defined REST API. This contract will be documented. The backend will also have an explicit contract with the medicare.gov API.
- **V. Secure by Design**: The application does not store user PII or PHI. API calls will adhere to the Referer header requirement.

**Structure Decision**: A standard monorepo with a `frontend` and `backend` directory is appropriate for this web application.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Output**: `data-model.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
