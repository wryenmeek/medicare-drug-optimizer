# Implementation Plan: Pharmacy Network Optimization

**Branch**: `004-id-like-the` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/004-id-like-the/spec.md`

## Summary
This feature will allow users to define their pharmacy preferences (e.g., travel distance, number of pharmacies) and then identify in-network or preferred pharmacy alternatives that could lower their drug costs. It will leverage the comprehensive pharmacy data, including precise location and network status, provided directly by the Medicare API (Feature 007).

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Requests (for API calls to Medicare API), React, Zustand
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Pytest, Vitest
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Constraints**: Relies on the Medicare API (Feature 007) providing comprehensive pharmacy data, including precise location (latitude/longitude) and network status.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: Leveraging structured data from the Medicare API simplifies pharmacy data acquisition. The UI will present clear preference settings and pharmacy recommendations.
- **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD will be applied to the logic for calculating distances (using API-provided coordinates), filtering pharmacies based on preferences, and estimating cost savings.
- **III. Automate Everything**: Automated tests will cover pharmacy data processing, preference filtering, and recommendation generation.
- **IV. Explicit Contracts**: New API endpoints will be defined for setting pharmacy preferences and retrieving pharmacy recommendations, all sourced from the Medicare API.
- **V. Secure by Design**: User location data (for distance calculation) will be handled securely and not persistently stored. API calls will adhere to the Referer header requirement.

**Structure Decision**: The existing monorepo structure is suitable. The `medicare_service` will be extended to handle pharmacy data from the Medicare API. A dedicated `pharmacy_service` might be re-scoped or removed depending on the API's output format.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
**Output**: `data-model.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate backend tasks for extending the `medicare_service` to fetch comprehensive pharmacy data from the Medicare API.
- Generate backend tasks for implementing the logic to filter pharmacies based on user preferences and API-provided coordinates.
- Generate new API endpoints for pharmacy preferences and recommendations.
- Generate frontend tasks for the UI to set preferences and display recommendations.
