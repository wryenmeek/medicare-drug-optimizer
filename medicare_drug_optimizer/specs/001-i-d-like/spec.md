**Feature Branch**: `001-i-d-like`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'd like to look up my medicare part d plan on medicare.gov and get guided step by step assistance optimizing my annual estimated drug costs on the plan I am currently enrolled in."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- **Q**: What should the fallback mechanism be for users who do not connect a medicare.gov account?
- **A**: The system should not require connecting a user's medicare.gov account. The primary workflow should use the unauthenticated services of medicare.gov/plan-compare. Login should be an optional enhancement.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A Medicare beneficiary wants to use the application to find their Part D plan and enter their drug list using medicare.gov's public, unauthenticated tools. They should then receive assistance from a chatbot or interactive agent to optimize costs. Optionally, they can log in to their medicare.gov account to import this information automatically.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has not logged in, **When** they start the process, **Then** the system guides them to find their plan and enter their drugs using public medicare.gov data.
2. **Given** a user has entered their plan and drugs, **When** they request optimization, **Then** the system provides cost-saving recommendations.
3. **Given** a user has the option to log in, **When** they choose to do so, **Then** the system attempts to automatically import their plan and drug list from their medicare.gov account.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a user-entered plan or drug cannot be found in the public data?
- How does the system handle an optional login attempt that fails or is cancelled?
- What is the workflow if an authenticated user has no saved plan or drugs on their medicare.gov account?

## Interaction & UX Flow

- **Loading State**: Display a loading animation.
- **Empty Data State**: Prompt users to enter data.
- **API Error State**: Communicate that the service is temporarily unavailable.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a primary workflow using the unauthenticated `medicare.gov/plan-compare` tool, allowing users to select a plan and create a drug list without logging in.

- **FR-004**: System MUST analyze the user's drug list (whether entered manually or imported) against their plan's formulary, including pricing tiers, copays, and deductibles.
- **FR-005**: A chatbot or interactive agent MUST present clear, actionable, and personalized cost-saving recommendations in a step-by-step format.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle and protect all user data, especially Protected Health Information (PHI), in a manner compliant with HIPAA standards, regardless of whether the user is authenticated.
- **FR-007**: The guidance provided MUST be purely informational and include disclaimers that it is not financial or medical advice.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: The Medicare beneficiary seeking to optimize their drug costs.
- **PartDPlan**: The user's prescription drug plan, containing details about its formulary, cost structure (deductibles, copays, tiers), and network pharmacies.
- **Drug**: A specific medication from the user's list, including its name, dosage, and quantity.
- **Recommendation**: A single, actionable suggestion for cost reduction (e.g., "Switch to a generic version," "Use a preferred pharmacy," "Ask your doctor about a therapeutic alternative").

## Integration & External Dependencies

- **medicare.gov/plan-compare API Failure Modes:**
  - **200**: Successful response.
  - **400**: Bad Request (invalid parameters, out-of-range requests).
  - **404**: Not Found (requested resource does not exist).
  - **500**: Server Error (server encountered an error).
- **Retry Strategy**: Not yet defined.
