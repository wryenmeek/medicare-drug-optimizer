# Implementation Plan: Frontend Architecture & Medicare.gov Design System Integration

**Branch**: `008-our-frontend-needs` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/008-our-frontend-needs/spec.md`

## Summary
This feature establishes the foundational frontend architecture as a Single Page Application (SPA) and integrates the official Medicare.gov Design System. It includes a strategy for handling UI elements not covered by the design system, ensuring a consistent, accessible, and on-brand user experience.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2022), Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: React (frontend), `ds-medicare-gov` (design system), `CMS-design-system` (fallback design system), FastAPI (backend), Requests (for API calls)
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Vitest (frontend), Pytest (backend)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Constraints**: Adherence to design system guidelines. Potential for breaking changes in design system updates.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: The SPA architecture is standard. Design system integration simplifies UI development and ensures consistency.
- **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD will be applied to custom frontend components and integration with the design system.
- **III. Automate Everything**: Automated tests will cover UI component rendering, design system adherence, and accessibility.
- **IV. Explicit Contracts**: The frontend will have an explicit contract with the backend API. The design system itself acts as a contract for UI components.
- **V. Secure by Design**: Frontend security best practices (e.g., XSS prevention) will be followed. No sensitive data is handled directly by the frontend.

**Structure Decision**: The existing monorepo structure is suitable. The frontend will be a React SPA, integrating the specified design systems.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
**Output**: `data-model.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate frontend tasks for setting up the React SPA.
- Generate frontend tasks for integrating the `ds-medicare-gov` and CMS Design System libraries.
- Generate frontend tasks for developing custom components where necessary, adhering to design system principles.
- Generate TDD tasks for UI components and design system integration.
