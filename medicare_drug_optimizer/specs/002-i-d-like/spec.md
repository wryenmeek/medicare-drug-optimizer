## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Medicare beneficiary, after connecting their account, wants the application to analyze each drug on their list and show them a comprehensive, categorized list of all covered alternatives (e.g., Generics, Biosimilars) available under their current Part D plan.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system has the user's current plan and drug list, **When** the user selects a drug from their list, **Then** the system displays a categorized list of all covered alternatives for that drug.
2. **Given** the system displays a list of alternatives, **When** a user selects a specific alternative, **Then** the system clearly shows its drug tier and estimated cost information.
3. **Given** the system displays drug alternatives, **Then** the categories (Brand, Generic, Biosimilar, Interchangeable Biologic) are clearly defined and explained to the user.

### Edge Cases
- How does the system respond if a specific drug on the user's list has no covered alternatives?
- How does the system handle drugs that are not on the plan's formulary to begin with?
- How does the system differentiate between direct chemical equivalents and therapeutic alternatives (a different drug for the same condition)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: For each drug on the user's list, the system MUST query the connected Part D plan's formulary to find all covered alternatives.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST categorize each discovered alternative as one of the following: Brand, Generic, Branded Generic, Biosimilar, or Interchangeable Biologic.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST present the list of alternatives to the user, grouped by category, for each of their drugs.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide clear, concise definitions for each of the alternative categories (Brand, Generic, etc.).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST explicitly inform the user when a drug on their list has no covered alternatives available on their plan.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST display the potential cost of an alternative by showing the total "Estimated Annual Cost" for that drug, using the official calculation from medicare.gov.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: The Medicare beneficiary seeking to understand their drug options.
- **PartDPlan**: The user's active prescription drug plan, including its specific formulary.
- **Drug**: A medication currently on the user's list.
- **DrugAlternative**: A covered alternative for a given drug, which includes its name, its category (e.g., Generic, Biosimilar), and its formulary details (e.g., tier, cost).
