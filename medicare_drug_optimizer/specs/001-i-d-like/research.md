# Research: Medicare Part D Drug Cost Optimizer

## Decision: Guided Assistance

- **What was chosen**: A chatbot or interactive agent providing real-time advice.
- **Rationale**: This approach offers dynamic and personalized guidance, aligning with the user's need for step-by-step assistance in optimizing costs.
- **Alternatives considered**: Step-by-step prompts and explanations within the UI; Automated suggestions presented after initial data entry; Links to external resources and educational materials.

## Decision: UserSession Lifecycle States

- **What was chosen**: Created, Active, Saved (user explicitly saves), Loaded (from saved state), Expired.
- **Rationale**: This lifecycle provides flexibility for users to save their progress and ensures session data is managed appropriately, supporting both short-term and longer-term user interactions.
- **Alternatives considered**: Created, Active, Expired (after inactivity), Terminated (user closes session); Transient (exists only during active use, no explicit states).

## Decision: UI States for Loading, Empty Data, and API Errors

- **What was chosen**: Loading animation for loading, prompt to enter data for empty data, service temporarily unavailable message for API errors.
- **Rationale**: These UI states provide clear and immediate feedback to the user, improving the overall user experience and guiding them through different application states.
- **Alternatives considered**: N/A (short answer provided by user).

## Decision: Medicare.gov Authentication Mechanism

- **What was chosen**: No authentication mechanism will be implemented.
- **Rationale**: This aligns with the primary workflow using unauthenticated services and simplifies the initial implementation by avoiding the complexities of secure third-party authentication.
- **Alternatives considered**: OAuth 2.0 with a reputable identity provider; SAML 2.0 for enterprise integration; Direct username/password submission (with strong encryption).

## Decision: Medicare.gov API Failure Modes

- **What was chosen**: 200 (Success), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error).
- **Rationale**: Understanding these standard HTTP status codes allows for robust error handling and user feedback when interacting with the external API.
- **Alternatives considered**: N/A (detailed response provided by user).

## Technical Decisions & Constraints

- **Language/Version**: Python 3.11, JavaScript (ES2022)
- **Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (Python backend), Requests (for API calls), React (frontend), Zustand (state management)
- **Storage**: N/A (Session data will be managed in-memory or in the client)
- **Testing**: Pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend)
- **Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
- **Project Type**: Web Application
- **Constraints**: Reliance on the structure and availability of the `medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API. Changes to the API may break the integration.
