# Feature Specification: Optimized Drug & Pharmacy Plan Generation

**Feature Branch**: `005-once-the-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "once the app has assembled a list of alternative drugs and a list of pharmacies that meet my needs, I'd like the application to find me the most affordable set of drugs at the most affordable set of pharmacies it can, for the lowest cost and the least amount of pain possible. I'd like to be presented the lowest cost option, the most convienient option, and the least painful option. I'd like the applicaiton to help me understand the tradeoffs between the three plans."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- **Q**: How should the "Balanced" / "Least Painful" plan be defined?
- **A**: The "Least Painful" plan requires: only one retail pharmacy within a user-set radius, the pharmacy can fill all the user's drugs, and the plan has no utilization restrictions (like Prior Authorization) on those drugs.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Medicare beneficiary, with a list of possible drug alternatives and pharmacy options, I want the application to generate and present me with a few optimized "fulfillment plans" that balance cost, convenience, and complexity, and help me understand the tradeoffs between them.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system has analyzed all drug and pharmacy alternatives, **When** the user requests final recommendations, **Then** the system presents at least three distinct fulfillment plans, such as "Lowest Cost," "Most Convenient," and "Least Painful."
2. **Given** the system presents the "Lowest Cost" plan, **Then** it details the specific combination of drugs (including alternatives) and pharmacies (one or more) that results in the absolute lowest estimated annual cost.
3. **Given** the system presents the "Most Convenient" plan, **Then** it details a drug and pharmacy combination that uses the fewest number of pharmacies (ideally one) while still offering significant savings.
4. **Given** the system presents the different plans, **Then** it provides a clear, side-by-side comparison that explains the tradeoffs (e.g., "The 'Lowest Cost' plan saves you an extra $150 per year, but requires you to visit two different pharmacies instead of one.").

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the "Lowest Cost" and "Most Convenient" plans are identical?
- The "Least Painful" option is defined as a plan using a single retail pharmacy within a user-set radius that can fill all drugs and has no utilization restrictions (e.g., Prior Authorization) on them.
- What does the system do if no meaningful alternatives were found in previous steps, preventing the generation of different plans?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST process the available drug alternatives and pharmacy options to generate and rank multiple optimized fulfillment plans.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST generate a "Lowest Cost" plan, which prioritizes minimizing the total estimated annual drug cost above all other factors, even if it requires using multiple pharmacies.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST generate a "Most Convenient" plan, which prioritizes using the minimum number of pharmacies (ideally one) and minimizing travel distance, while still providing cost savings.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST generate a "Least Painful" plan, defined as the lowest-cost option that uses a single retail pharmacy within a user-set radius, where that pharmacy can fill all the user's drugs, and the plan imposes no utilization restrictions (e.g., Prior Authorization) on those drugs.
- **FR-005**: For each generated fulfillment plan, the system MUST clearly list:
    - The total estimated annual cost.
    - The total estimated annual savings compared to the user's current setup.
    - The specific drugs (and their chosen alternatives) to be filled.
    - The specific pharmacy or pharmacies to be used for filling the prescriptions.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST present a summary view that clearly compares the key tradeoffs (total cost, total savings, number of pharmacies) between the generated plans.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: The Medicare beneficiary.
- **FulfillmentPlan**: A complete, actionable plan for a user to get their prescriptions. It is a specific combination of drugs to be filled at a specific combination of pharmacies, and includes the total cost and savings.
- **PlanComparison**: A summary view that highlights the key differences between the generated Fulfillment Plans to help the user make an informed decision.
