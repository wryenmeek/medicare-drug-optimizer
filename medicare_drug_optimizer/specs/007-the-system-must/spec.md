# Feature Specification: Medicare.gov Plan Compare API Integration

**Feature Branch**: `007-the-system-must`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the system must use https://www.medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/ for data on plans, drugs, pharmacies and all associated metadata."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- **Q**: What are the authentication requirements for accessing the necessary data from the `https://www.medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API?
- **A**: Access requires setting the "Referer" request header to "https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/". This permits access to all unauthenticated API functionality.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system, I need to directly integrate with the `https://www.medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API endpoint to efficiently retrieve comprehensive data on plans, drugs, pharmacies, and all associated metadata, ensuring data accuracy and reducing reliance on browser automation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system needs plan data, **When** it calls the `medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API, **Then** it can successfully retrieve plan details (e.g., plan ID, name, issuer, formulary information).
2. **Given** the system needs drug data, **When** it calls the `medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API, **Then** it can successfully retrieve drug information, including formulary status, pricing tiers, copays, deductibles, and restrictions.
3. **Given** the `medicare.gov` API updates (e.g., version changes, data structure modifications), **Then** the system's integration remains robust and adaptable with minimal maintenance.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the API is down, unresponsive, or returns unexpected errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx status codes)?
- How does the system handle changes to the API's version or data structure (e.g., new fields, deprecated fields)?
- What are the rate limits or usage policies for this API, and how does the system adhere to them to avoid service interruptions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST be able to make unauthenticated requests to `https://www.medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` by setting the "Referer" HTTP header to "https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/".
- **FR-002**: The system MUST be able to retrieve plan data, including plan ID, name, issuer, and formulary information, via the API.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST be able to retrieve drug data, including formulary status, pricing tiers, copays, deductibles, and restrictions, via the API.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST be able to retrieve pharmacy data, including network status and location details, via the API.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST implement robust error handling for API unavailability, unexpected responses, or rate limiting.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST be designed to be resilient to API version changes and data structure updates.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MedicarePlanCompareAPI**: Represents the `https://www.medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API endpoint as the primary data source for plans, drugs, and pharmacies.
