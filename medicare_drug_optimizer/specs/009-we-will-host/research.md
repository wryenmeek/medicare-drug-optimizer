# Research: GitHub Pages Deployment Strategy

## Decision
The frontend Single Page Application (SPA) will be deployed to GitHub Pages using an automated GitHub Actions workflow. Client-side routing will be implemented using hash-based routing.

## Rationale
This strategy directly addresses the user's requirement for GitHub Pages hosting and provides a robust solution for SPA routing on static hosts.

- **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions provides a seamless and efficient way to automate the build and deployment process upon code changes, reducing manual effort and potential errors.
- **Hash-based Routing**: This is the most straightforward and reliable method for client-side routing on GitHub Pages, as it does not require server-side configuration or complex redirect tricks.
- **Cost-Effective Hosting**: GitHub Pages offers free hosting for static sites, aligning with cost-effectiveness goals.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Manual Deployment**: Manually building the frontend and pushing it to the `gh-pages` branch. This was **rejected** due to inefficiency, increased potential for human error, and lack of integration with CI/CD best practices.
- **404 Redirect Trick for Clean URLs**: Implementing a custom `404.html` to redirect unknown paths to `index.html` for clean URLs. This was **rejected** in favor of hash-based routing due to its simpler implementation and fewer potential edge cases on GitHub Pages.
- **Other Static Site Hosts (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)**: While offering more features, these were **rejected** as the user explicitly requested GitHub Pages. They could be considered for future enhancements if GitHub Pages limitations become a significant constraint.
