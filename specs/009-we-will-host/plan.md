# Implementation Plan: GitHub Pages Deployment Strategy

**Branch**: `009-we-will-host` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/009-we-will-host/spec.md`

## Summary
This feature defines the deployment strategy for the frontend Single Page Application (SPA) to GitHub Pages. It will involve configuring the build process for GitHub Pages and ensuring correct hash-based routing for the SPA, with automated deployment via GitHub Actions.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2022), Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: React (frontend), GitHub Actions (CI/CD), FastAPI (backend)
**Storage**: N/A (GitHub Pages hosts static assets)
**Testing**: Vitest (frontend), Pytest (backend)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (hosted on GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Constraints**: GitHub Pages limitations (e.g., no server-side logic, API communication via CORS). Hash-based routing is required for SPA client-side routing.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: GitHub Pages provides a simple, cost-effective hosting solution for the static frontend. Hash-based routing is a straightforward approach for SPA on static hosts.
- **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD will be applied to the build and deployment scripts to ensure they function correctly.
- **III. Automate Everything**: Deployment will be fully automated via GitHub Actions.
- **IV. Explicit Contracts**: The frontend will communicate with the backend API via a well-defined REST API, respecting CORS policies.
- **V. Secure by Design**: GitHub Pages provides secure HTTPS hosting. Frontend will not handle sensitive data directly. Backend API will be hosted separately and secured.

```

**Structure Decision**: The existing monorepo structure is suitable. A new GitHub Actions workflow will be added for frontend deployment.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
**Output**: `data-model.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks for configuring the frontend build process for GitHub Pages.
- Generate tasks for implementing hash-based routing in the frontend SPA.
- Generate tasks for creating the GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment.
- Generate tasks for configuring frontend API communication for the GitHub Pages environment.
