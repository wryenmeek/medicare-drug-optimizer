# Research: Interacting with Medicare.gov

## Decision
The application will interact with the `medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API directly.

## Rationale
The user has clarified that a direct API is available and provides comprehensive data, making it the preferred method over browser automation.

- **Direct API is More Robust**: Direct API calls are generally more stable, faster, and less prone to breaking due to UI changes compared to browser automation.
- **Referer Header Requirement**: The API requires setting the "Referer" HTTP header to "https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/". This is a known and manageable security measure.
- **Comprehensive Data**: The API provides all necessary data for plans, drugs, pharmacies, and associated metadata, reducing the need for multiple data sources.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Browser Automation (Playwright)**: This approach was initially considered but is now **rejected** as the primary integration method because a direct API is available. Browser automation is more brittle, slower, and resource-intensive. It may be considered as a fallback if the API proves insufficient for specific data points.
- **Reverse-Engineering Internal APIs**: This approach was previously rejected and remains so, as the official API is now known.
- **Static HTML Scraping**: This approach was previously rejected and remains so.
