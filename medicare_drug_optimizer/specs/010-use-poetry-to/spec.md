# Feature Specification: Use Poetry for Python Dependency Management

**Feature Branch**: `010-use-poetry-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "use poetry to manage python .venv for the project, python dependencies, and python dependency configuration"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Python developer, I want to use Poetry to manage the project's virtual environment, install and manage Python dependencies, and configure dependency resolution, so that the development environment is consistent, reproducible, and easy to set up.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new developer sets up the project, **When** they run the Poetry installation command, **Then** a virtual environment is created and all Python dependencies are installed.
2. **Given** a new Python dependency is required, **When** a developer adds it using Poetry, **Then** the dependency is added to `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
3. **Given** an existing Python dependency needs to be updated, **When** a developer updates it using Poetry, **Then** the dependency is updated in `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if Poetry is not installed on the developer's machine?
- How does the system handle conflicts in dependency versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST use Poetry for Python dependency management.
- **FR-002**: Poetry MUST manage the project's virtual environment.
- **FR-003**: Poetry MUST install and manage all Python project dependencies.
- **FR-004**: Poetry MUST generate and maintain `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files for dependency configuration and locking.
- **FR-005**: The project setup instructions MUST include steps for initializing Poetry.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST explicitly handle the installation of Poetry itself as part of the setup process.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST automatically resolve dependency version conflicts using Poetry's default strategy.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide a mechanism (utility or guide) to migrate existing `requirements.txt` based projects to Poetry.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Dependency resolution (e.g., `poetry install`) MUST complete in less than 5 minutes.
- **NFR-002**: Poetry MUST support Python versions 3.11 and 3.10.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Poetry**: A Python dependency management and packaging tool.
- **Virtual Environment**: An isolated Python environment for the project.
- **Python Dependencies**: Libraries and packages required by the project.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Poetry's main configuration file for project metadata and dependencies.
- **`poetry.lock`**: A file generated by Poetry that locks the exact versions of all dependencies for reproducible builds.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: Should the system explicitly handle the installation of Poetry itself, or is that an out-of-scope prerequisite? → A: Poetry installation is an explicit part of the system's setup.
- Q: How should the system handle dependency version conflicts detected by Poetry? → A: Automatically resolve conflicts using Poetry's default strategy.
- Q: Are there any specific performance targets for dependency resolution (e.g., maximum time for `poetry install`)? → A: less that 5 minutes
- Q: Are there any specific Python versions or environments that Poetry must support or explicitly exclude? → A: Yes, Python 3.11 and 3.10.
- Q: Should the system provide a mechanism to migrate existing `requirements.txt` based projects to Poetry? → A: Yes, provide a migration utility/guide.
