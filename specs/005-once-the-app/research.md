# Research: Optimization Algorithm for Plan Generation

## Decision
The application will implement a multi-objective optimization algorithm to generate the "Lowest Cost," "Most Convenient," and "Least Painful" fulfillment plans. This algorithm will evaluate combinations of drugs (including alternatives) and pharmacies against defined criteria, utilizing comprehensive data provided by the Medicare API (Feature 007).

## Rationale
Generating optimal plans requires a systematic and efficient approach to explore the vast number of possible combinations of drugs and pharmacies. The availability of comprehensive and structured data from the Medicare API (Feature 007) simplifies the input to the optimization algorithm.

- **Ensure Optimality**: Guarantee that the generated plans truly represent the best options according to the defined criteria.
- **Handle Complexity**: Efficiently process a large number of variables (drugs, alternatives, pharmacies, preferences, restrictions) to find solutions within reasonable timeframes.
- **Provide Tradeoffs**: Clearly illustrate the compromises between different objectives (cost vs. convenience vs. pain).
- **Simplified Data Input**: Direct access to comprehensive data via the Medicare API streamlines the data acquisition phase for the optimization algorithm.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Brute-Force Enumeration**: Trying every single possible combination of drugs and pharmacies. This was **rejected** as computationally infeasible and extremely slow for even a moderate number of drugs and pharmacies.
- **Simple Rule-Based Heuristics**: Implementing a series of simple rules (e.g., "always pick the cheapest generic"). This was **rejected** because it might miss truly optimal solutions and would struggle to balance multiple objectives effectively.
- **Linear Programming / Mixed-Integer Programming**: While powerful, these methods can be overly complex for this problem's initial scope and might require specialized solvers. This was **deferred** as a potential future enhancement if the problem complexity significantly increases.
