# Medicare Drug Optimizer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity and Clarity
All code, architecture, and documentation MUST be as simple and clear as possible. Complexity is not a feature and MUST be explicitly justified against the project's long-term goals. Rationale: Simple systems are easier to build, maintain, debug, and secure.

### II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All production code MUST be driven by tests. A failing test that reproduces a bug or defines a new feature MUST be written before the corresponding code. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is the required standard for all changes. Rationale: TDD ensures a comprehensive test suite, improves design quality, and provides a safety net for refactoring.

### III. Automate Everything
Every repetitive process in the development lifecycle MUST be automated. This includes, but is not limited to, testing, static analysis, dependency management, builds, and deployments. Rationale: Automation reduces human error, improves consistency, and frees up developers to focus on value-adding work.

### IV. Explicit Contracts
All internal and external services, modules, and APIs MUST have well-defined, documented, and versioned contracts. Changes to contracts MUST be treated as breaking changes and follow a managed rollout. Rationale: Explicit contracts prevent integration failures and enable independent development and deployment of components.

### V. Secure by Design
Security is a foundational, non-negotiable requirement. It MUST be integrated into every stage of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment and operations. All changes MUST be evaluated for security impact. Rationale: Addressing security as an afterthought is expensive, ineffective, and high-risk.

## Additional Constraints

TODO(Technology Stack): Define the required technology stack, frameworks, and libraries. This section will enforce technology choices to ensure consistency and maintainability across the project.

## Development Workflow

TODO(Development Workflow): Outline the branching strategy, code review process, and CI/CD pipeline requirements. This section will define the process for contributing code, ensuring quality, and releasing software.

## Governance

This Constitution is the supreme governing document for the Medicare Drug Optimizer project. It supersedes all other practices, conventions, and team preferences.

- **Compliance**: All code reviews MUST explicitly validate that changes comply with the principles outlined in this constitution.
- **Amendments**: Any amendment to this constitution requires a formal proposal, a team-wide review, and an update to the version number following Semantic Versioning rules.
- **Versioning**:
    - **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes, such as removing a principle.
    - **MINOR**: Adding a new principle or a significant new requirement.
    - **PATCH**: Clarifications, typo fixes, or minor wording changes.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-06 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-06
