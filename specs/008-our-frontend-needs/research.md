# Research: Frontend Design System Integration

## Decision
The frontend will be a React Single Page Application (SPA) that integrates the `ds-medicare-gov` design system as its primary UI component library. For any UI elements or patterns not covered by `ds-medicare-gov`, the application will first fallback to the main CMS Design System library. If still unavailable, custom components will be developed, strictly adhering to the principles and visual language of the Medicare Design System.

## Rationale
This approach directly addresses the user's requirements for an SPA that leverages the official Medicare.gov Design System, while providing a clear and consistent strategy for handling gaps.

- **Consistency and Accessibility**: Using official design systems ensures a consistent user experience and adherence to accessibility standards.
- **Efficiency**: Leveraging existing component libraries reduces development time for common UI elements.
- **Clear Fallback Strategy**: The multi-tiered fallback (ds-medicare-gov -> CMS Design System -> custom) provides a structured way to handle missing components, maintaining design integrity.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Solely Custom Component Development**: Building all UI components from scratch. This was **rejected** as highly inefficient, prone to inconsistencies, and would likely fail to meet accessibility standards without significant additional effort.
- **Using a Generic Third-Party Component Library**: Relying on a library like Material UI or Chakra UI. This was **rejected** because it would deviate from the specific requirement to use the Medicare.gov Design System and would not provide the desired on-brand experience.
- **No Fallback Strategy**: Proceeding without a clear plan for missing components. This was **rejected** as it would lead to inconsistent UI, increased technical debt, and potential delays when gaps are encountered.
