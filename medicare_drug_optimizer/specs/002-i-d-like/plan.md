# Implementation Plan: Covered Drug Alternatives Discovery

**Branch**: `002-i-d-like` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/002-i-d-like/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature will analyze a user's drug list and, for each drug, find all possible covered alternatives (Generics, Biosimilars, etc.) offered by their plan. This involves integrating with the Medicare API (Feature 007) to find relationships between drugs and then checking those alternatives against the plan's formulary data.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Requests (for API calls to Medicare API), React, Zustand
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Pytest, Vitest
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Constraints**: Relies on the Medicare API (Feature 007) for comprehensive drug alternative relationships.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: The architecture will leverage the existing Medicare API integration, keeping the new complexity contained within the drug alternatives logic.
- **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD will be used for the logic that maps Medicare API drug relationships to the categories required by the spec (Brand, Generic, etc.).
- **III. Automate Everything**: All tests, including integration tests for the Medicare API drug alternatives service, will be automated.
- **IV. Explicit Contracts**: The backend will expose a new API endpoint to provide the list of alternatives for a given drug. This contract will be clearly defined.
- **V. Secure by Design**: The Medicare API is public and does not require credentials beyond the Referer header. No new sensitive user data is being handled.

**Structure Decision**: The existing frontend/backend monorepo structure is well-suited for this extension. The `medicare_service` will be extended to handle drug alternative data from the Medicare API.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Output**: `data-model.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Generate backend tasks for extending the `medicare_service` to fetch drug alternative relationships from the Medicare API.
- Generate backend tasks for the logic to process Medicare API data and categorize alternatives.
- Generate a new API endpoint in the backend to serve the alternatives.
- Generate frontend tasks to call the new endpoint and display the categorized alternatives to the user.
