# Feature Specification: Covered Drug Alternatives Discovery

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-d-like`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'd like the application to review my drug list on medicare.gov and discover all the possible covered alternatives my plan offers. Tell me the Brands, Generics, Branded Generics, Biosimilars, and Interchangable Biologics that are covered by my plan for each drug on my drug list"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- **Q**: When showing the cost implications of switching to a drug alternative, how should the system present the information?
- **A**: Show the Estimated Annual Cost, using the official total annual estimated cost figure from medicare.gov.
- **Q**: The spec mentions "therapeutic alternatives" as an edge case but doesn't clarify if they are in scope. Should the system ONLY show chemically equivalent drugs, or also include different drugs for the same condition (therapeutic alternatives)?
- **A**: The only alternatives supported by medicare.gov are biosimilars, interchagable biologics, generics, and brands. Exclude therapeutic alternatives.
- **Q**: To ensure data accuracy when looking up drug alternatives, how should the system uniquely identify a specific drug?
- **A**: medicare.gov uses the RxCUI to identify a drug but requires NDCs to estimate the price of a particular drug pagckage and dosage
- **Q**: When a user requests to see drug alternatives, what is the maximum acceptable time they should have to wait for the results to be displayed?
- **A**: > 10 seconds: Acceptable for complex, non-interactive calculations.
- **Q**: If the external medicare.gov API is unavailable or returns an error while fetching drug alternatives, how should the system respond?
- **A**: Show a clear error message: Inform the user that the data cannot be retrieved at this time and suggest trying again later.
- **Q**: Are there any specific data privacy or security requirements for handling the user's drug list, beyond standard industry practices for sensitive health information?
- **A**: A. As a single page application the system should securely store this information in the browser session only.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Medicare beneficiary, after connecting their account, wants the application to analyze each drug on their list and show them a comprehensive, categorized list of all covered alternatives (e.g., Generics, Biosimilars) available under their current Part D plan.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system has the user's current plan and drug list, **When** the user selects a drug from their list, **Then** the system displays a categorized list of all covered alternatives for that drug.
2. **Given** the system displays a list of alternatives, **When** a user selects a specific alternative, **Then** the system clearly shows its drug tier and estimated cost information.
3. **Given** the system displays drug alternatives, **Then** the categories (Brand, Generic, Biosimilar, Interchangeable Biologic) are clearly defined and explained to the user.

### Edge Cases
- How does the system respond if a specific drug on the user's list has no covered alternatives?
- How does the system handle drugs that are not on the plan's formulary to begin with?
- Therapeutic alternatives (a different drug for the same condition) are explicitly out of scope.
- If the external medicare.gov API is unavailable or returns an error, the system should inform the user and suggest trying again later.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: For each drug on the user's list, the system MUST query the connected Part D plan's formulary to find all covered alternatives.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST categorize each discovered alternative as one of the following: Brand, Generic, Branded Generic, Biosimilar, or Interchangeable Biologic.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST present the list of alternatives to the user, grouped by category, for each of their drugs.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide clear, concise definitions for each of the alternative categories (Brand, Generic, etc.).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST explicitly inform the user when a drug on their list has no covered alternatives available on their plan.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST display the potential cost of an alternative by showing the total "Estimated Annual Cost" for that drug, using the official calculation from medicare.gov.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST only include chemically equivalent or closely related substitutes (Brand, Generic, Branded Generic, Biosimilar, or Interchangeable Biologic) and MUST NOT include therapeutic alternatives (different drugs for the same condition).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
*Note: All user-specific data, including their drug list and plan information, is transient and must only be stored in the user's browser session.*
- **User**: The Medicare beneficiary seeking to understand their drug options.
- **PartDPlan**: The user's active prescription drug plan, including its specific formulary.
- **Drug**: A medication currently on the user's list. It is identified by its RxCUI for general identification and may have multiple NDCs for specific packages/dosages.
- **DrugAlternative**: A covered alternative for a given drug, which includes its name, its category (e.g., Generic, Biosimilar), and its formulary details (e.g., tier, cost). It is also identified by its RxCUI and NDC.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The system may take longer than 10 seconds to retrieve drug alternatives, and should provide clear feedback to the user during this time (e.g., a loading indicator).
- **NFR-002**: The application must function as a single-page application (SPA) and must not store the user's drug list or any other sensitive information on the backend. All sensitive data should be stored securely in the browser session only and cleared when the session ends.
