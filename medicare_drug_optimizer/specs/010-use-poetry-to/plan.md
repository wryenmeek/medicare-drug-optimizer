# Implementation Plan: Use Poetry for Python Dependency Management

**Branch**: `010-use-poetry-to` | **Date**: 2025-10-08 | **Spec**: /specs/010-use-poetry-to/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/010-use-poetry-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The feature aims to manage Python dependencies using Poetry, ensuring a consistent and reproducible development environment. This involves Poetry installation, virtual environment management, dependency installation/updates, and maintaining `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`. The system will automatically resolve dependency conflicts and support Python 3.11 and 3.10, with dependency resolution completing in under 5 minutes. A migration mechanism from `requirements.txt` to Poetry will also be provided.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, 3.10  
**Primary Dependencies**: Poetry  
**Storage**: N/A (Dependency management is file-based)  
**Testing**: pytest (for backend, if applicable to Poetry's integration), Poetry's internal testing mechanisms.  
**Target Platform**: Developer workstations (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
**Project Type**: Single (Python project)  
**Performance Goals**: Dependency resolution (`poetry install`) < 5 minutes.  
**Constraints**: N/A  
**Scale/Scope**: Single project dependency management.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [X] **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: Using Poetry promotes simplicity and clarity in dependency management.
- [X] **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The plan will incorporate TDD for any scripts or utilities developed as part of this feature.
- [X] **III. Automate Everything**: Poetry itself is an automation tool for dependency management. The feature aims to automate setup and management.
- [X] **IV. Explicit Contracts**: Poetry's `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` serve as explicit contracts for dependencies.
- [X] **V. Secure by Design**: Poetry helps with reproducible builds, which contributes to security by ensuring consistent dependency versions.
- [X] **TODO(Technology Stack)**: This feature *defines* the technology stack for Python dependency management (Poetry). This is being addressed by the feature itself.
- [X] **TODO(Development Workflow)**: This feature will impact the development workflow by introducing Poetry. This will be documented in the setup instructions.

├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/tasks command - NOT created by /plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)
```
.
├── backend/
│   └── ... (existing structure)
├── frontend/
│   └── ... (existing structure)
├── pyproject.toml      # New: Poetry's project configuration
└── poetry.lock         # New: Poetry's lock file
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project with Poetry configuration files at the root.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType gemini`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
