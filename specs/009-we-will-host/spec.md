# Feature Specification: GitHub Pages Deployment Strategy

**Feature Branch**: `009-we-will-host`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we will host our application on github pages"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- **Q**: For client-side routing of the Single Page Application (SPA) on GitHub Pages, which strategy should be implemented?
- **A**: Hash-based Routing (Use URL hashes for routing, which works out-of-the-box with static hosting).

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I need the application's frontend to be deployable and hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring easy access, cost-effective hosting, and a streamlined deployment process for the Single Page Application (SPA).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the frontend application is built and ready for deployment, **When** it is deployed to GitHub Pages, **Then** it is accessible via a public URL (e.g., `username.github.io/repo-name/`).
2. **Given** the application is hosted on GitHub Pages, **When** a user accesses it, **Then** all frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) load correctly, and the SPA routing functions as expected.
3. **Given** the application is hosted on GitHub Pages, **When** the backend API is available (hosted separately), **Then** the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend API to fetch and send data.

### Edge Cases
- How does GitHub Pages handle client-side routing for a Single Page Application (SPA) without server-side configuration (e.g., 404s for direct URL access)?
- What are the limitations of GitHub Pages (e.g., custom domains, SSL, build times, bandwidth) that might impact the application's performance or scalability?
- How will the backend API be hosted, and what is the strategy for the frontend to securely and reliably communicate with it, considering potential cross-origin restrictions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The frontend application MUST be deployable to GitHub Pages.
- **FR-002**: The deployment process MUST ensure correct client-side routing for the Single Page Application (SPA) on GitHub Pages using hash-based routing.
- **FR-003**: The frontend application MUST be configured to correctly communicate with the backend API, regardless of the GitHub Pages hosting environment (e.g., using environment variables for API URL).
- **FR-004**: The deployment process MUST be automated (e.g., via GitHub Actions) to build and deploy new versions of the frontend to GitHub Pages upon code changes to the main branch.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **FrontendApplication**: The built Single Page Application (SPA) code and assets.
- **GitHubPages**: The hosting service provided by GitHub for static websites.
- **BackendAPI**: The separately hosted API that the frontend communicates with.
