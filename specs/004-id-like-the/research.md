# Research: Geocoding and Pharmacy Data

## Decision
The application will primarily rely on the `medicare.gov/api/v1/data/plan-compare/` API (Feature 007) to provide comprehensive pharmacy data, including precise location (latitude/longitude) and network status.

## Rationale
The user has clarified that the Medicare API provides comprehensive pharmacy data, making it the preferred and authoritative source.

- **Authoritative Source**: The Medicare API is the official source for plan and pharmacy data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Data**: The API provides precise location (latitude/longitude) and network status, reducing the need for external geocoding services and separate pharmacy directories.
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Relying on a single, comprehensive API reduces the number of external dependencies and simplifies the architecture.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Third-party Geocoding API (e.g., Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap Nominatim)**: This was initially considered but is now **rejected** as redundant because the Medicare API (Feature 007) provides precise location data.
- **Medicare.gov via Browser Automation (Playwright)**: This was initially considered but is now **rejected** as the primary integration method because a direct API is available.
- **Public Pharmacy Directories**: This was initially considered but is now **rejected** as redundant because the Medicare API (Feature 007) provides comprehensive pharmacy data.
