# Implementation Plan: Optimized Drug & Pharmacy Plan Generation

**Branch**: `005-once-the-app` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/005-once-the-app/spec.md`

## Summary
This feature will generate and present optimized "fulfillment plans" that balance cost, convenience, and complexity, based on the user's drug list, available alternatives, and pharmacy preferences. It will leverage the comprehensive data provided by the Medicare API (Feature 007) for all underlying information.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, JavaScript (ES2022)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Requests (for API calls to Medicare API), React, Zustand, **Optimization Algorithm Library (TBD)**
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Pytest, Vitest
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Constraints**: The complexity of the optimization algorithm will depend on the number of drugs, alternatives, and pharmacies. Performance may be a concern for very large datasets. Relies on the Medicare API (Feature 007) providing all necessary underlying data.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Simplicity and Clarity**: The optimization logic will be encapsulated in a dedicated backend service. The UI will clearly present the generated plans and their tradeoffs. Data acquisition is simplified by relying on a single, comprehensive API.
- **II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD will be critical for developing and validating the optimization algorithm, ensuring it produces correct and optimal results.
- **III. Automate Everything**: Automated tests will cover the optimization algorithm, plan generation, and comparison logic.
- **IV. Explicit Contracts**: The backend API will expose endpoints for requesting optimized plans and receiving structured plan comparisons. The underlying data is sourced via the explicit contract of the Medicare API.
- **V. Secure by Design**: No new sensitive data is introduced. The optimization operates on data retrieved from the Medicare API.

**Structure Decision**: The existing monorepo structure is suitable. A new `optimization_service` will be added to the backend.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
**Output**: `data-model.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do.*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate backend tasks for developing the `optimization_service` to implement the plan generation algorithm.
- Generate backend tasks for integrating the optimization service with existing data services (which now rely on the Medicare API).
- Generate new API endpoints for requesting and retrieving optimized plans.
- Generate frontend tasks for the UI to display the generated plans and their comparisons.
