# Feature Specification: Medicare.gov Plan Compare Integration

**Feature Branch**: `006-the-system-needs`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Deprecated  
**Input**: User description: "the system needs to rely on the medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/ site and it's API"

---
**Note**: This feature has been deprecated. Its functionality, which relied on browser automation, is now superseded by Feature `007-the-system-must` (Medicare.gov Plan Compare API Integration), which provides direct API access to the necessary data.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system, I need to reliably interact with the `medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/` website and its underlying API to retrieve plan and drug information, enabling core application functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system needs to retrieve plan data, **When** it accesses `medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/`, **Then** it can successfully extract relevant plan details (e.g., plan ID, name, issuer).
2. **Given** the system needs to retrieve drug coverage information, **When** it interacts with the `medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/` site or its underlying API, **Then** it can successfully submit drug lists and retrieve associated formulary and cost information.
3. **Given** the `medicare.gov` site undergoes minor updates (e.g., UI changes, API version bumps), **Then** the system's integration remains robust and adaptable with minimal maintenance.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the `medicare.gov` site is temporarily down, unresponsive, or returns unexpected errors?
- How does the system handle significant changes to the `medicare.gov` site's user interface or underlying API structure?
- What are the rate limits or usage policies for interacting with `medicare.gov`, and how does the system adhere to them?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST be able to programmatically navigate to and interact with the `medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/` website.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST be able to extract plan details (e.g., plan ID, name, issuer) from the `medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/` site.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST be able to submit drug lists and retrieve associated formulary and cost information from the `medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/` site or its underlying API.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST implement robust error handling for `medicare.gov` site unavailability, unexpected responses, or changes in site structure.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST be designed to be resilient to minor UI changes on `medicare.gov` through flexible selectors or adaptive strategies.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MedicarePlanCompareSite**: Represents the external `medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/` website as a data source and interaction point.
- **MedicarePlanCompareAPI**: Represents the underlying API (if directly accessible or discoverable) used by the `medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/` site.
