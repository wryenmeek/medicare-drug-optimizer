# Feature Specification: Frontend Architecture & Medicare.gov Design System Integration

**Feature Branch**: `008-our-frontend-needs`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "our frontend needs to be a single page application that relies on the medicare.gov design system as much as possible. the repo is here: https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/packages/ds-medicare-gov"

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- **Q**: When a required UI element or pattern is not available in the `ds-medicare-gov` design system, what is the preferred strategy?
- **A**: Fallback to the main CMS Design System library the medicare design system inherits from. If that doesn't work develop custom components that adhere to the medicare design system principles.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a frontend developer, I need the application's user interface to be built as a Single Page Application (SPA) that consistently utilizes the official Medicare.gov Design System components and guidelines, ensuring a familiar, accessible, and on-brand user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application loads, **When** the user interacts with any page, **Then** it behaves as a Single Page Application (SPA) without full page reloads, providing a fluid user experience.
2. **Given** a UI component is rendered (e.g., a button, a form input, a navigation element), **When** it corresponds to an available Medicare.gov Design System component, **Then** it uses the official design system component, adhering to its visual and interactive specifications.
3. **Given** the application is built, **Then** it adheres to the accessibility standards and best practices promoted by the Medicare.gov Design System, ensuring usability for all users.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a required UI component or pattern is not available in the Medicare.gov Design System? How should such gaps be addressed?
- How does the system handle custom styling or components that deviate from the design system, and what guidelines are in place for such deviations?
- What is the strategy for keeping the design system dependency updated, and how are breaking changes managed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The frontend MUST be implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
- **FR-002**: The frontend MUST integrate and utilize components from the `ds-medicare-gov` design system (from `https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/packages/ds-medicare-gov`) as its primary UI component library.
- **FR-003**: The frontend MUST adhere to the styling, typography, and accessibility guidelines provided by the Medicare.gov Design System.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST implement a strategy for handling UI elements not covered by the `ds-medicare-gov` design system: first, fallback to the main CMS Design System library; if still unavailable, develop custom components that adhere to `ds-medicare-gov` principles.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST establish a process for managing updates to the `ds-medicare-gov` dependency, including testing for breaking changes and planning for migration.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **FrontendApplication**: The Single Page Application (SPA) itself, responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with the backend.
- **MedicareGovDesignSystem**: The `ds-medicare-gov` component library and its associated documentation, serving as the source of truth for UI/UX.
