**Feature Branch**: `004-id-like-the`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Id like the application to review my selected pharmacies and help me find preffered or in network alternatives on my plan. I'd like the app to take my preferences into account: how many pharmacies I am willing to go to to get the best price. How far I am willing to drive to go to one or more retail pharmacies. Which area pharmacies will I simply never use? etc"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Medicare beneficiary, I want the application to analyze my current pharmacies and help me find in-network or preferred pharmacy alternatives that could lower my drug costs, based on my personal preferences for travel distance, number of pharmacies, and specific locations to avoid.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has set their pharmacy preferences (max travel distance, max number of pharmacies, excluded pharmacies), **When** they request a pharmacy optimization, **Then** the system displays a list of alternative pharmacies or pharmacy combinations that offer lower costs.
2. **Given** the system displays alternative pharmacies, **Then** it clearly indicates whether each is a standard in-network or a preferred pharmacy and explains the difference.
3. **Given** the system displays pharmacy recommendations, **Then** it shows the estimated cost savings for filling the user's drug list at those locations compared to their current pharmacy setup.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if there are no preferred pharmacies within the user's specified travel distance?
- How does the system incorporate mail-order pharmacies as a potential cost-saving alternative?
- What is the workflow if the user's plan does not have a preferred pharmacy network tier?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow the user to set, save, and update their pharmacy-related preferences.
- **FR-002**: User preferences MUST include:
    - Maximum travel distance in miles they are willing to drive to a pharmacy.
    - Maximum number of different pharmacies they are willing to use to fill all their prescriptions.
    - A list of specific local pharmacies to exclude from all recommendations.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST identify all in-network pharmacies for the user's Part D plan that are within the specified travel distance from the user's location.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST differentiate between standard in-network and preferred pharmacies, explaining the potential cost differences to the user.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST be able to calculate and display potential cost savings by using alternative pharmacy combinations that adhere to the user's stated preferences.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide location, contact information, and hours for all recommended pharmacies.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST consider mail-order pharmacy options if they are part of the user's plan and present them as an alternative.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: The Medicare beneficiary.
- **PartDPlan**: The user's prescription drug plan, including its specific pharmacy network (standard and preferred tiers).
- **Pharmacy**: A retail or mail-order pharmacy, which includes its location, contact details, and network status (in-network, preferred, out-of-network).
- **UserPharmacyPreferences**: A saved set of user-defined rules for pharmacy selection, including maximum travel distance, maximum number of unique pharmacies, and a list of excluded locations.
- **PharmacyRecommendation**: A suggested pharmacy or combination of pharmacies that optimizes cost based on the user's drug list and their saved preferences.
